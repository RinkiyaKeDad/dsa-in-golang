# Data Structures and Algorithms in Golang

Hey! So you want to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, huh? You're in the right place! But before we dive in, I want to align your expectations and share a bit about what motivated me to start this project.

I’ve been writing [technical articles](https://arshsharma.com/) for quite a few years now. Back in college, all my friends were busy practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to prepare for their job interviews. I gave it a shot as well, but I found the whole process thoroughly boring and seemingly useless (yes those were my exact words back then). I enjoyed creating things and working with technologies far more than grinding LeetCode problems. I even challenged myself to land a job without rigorously practicing DSA — and I did!

However, later in my career, when I switched to a technical marketing role, something clicked and made me want to go back to DSA. Let’s call it a “calling” for the sake of being dramatic. I decided to give learning them another shot, this time with a genuine curiosity to understand the concepts, and I started having fun! It felt like “leveling up” in [Elden Ring](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/dont-panic/) haha. That’s when I thought of creating this project.

Another motivation for starting this project is the lack of resources for DSA in Golang. Most content out there is targeted at beginners or college students, and languages like Python or Java tend to dominate in that space. Go, being less common for beginners, didn’t have as many accessible references and I wanted to change that.

So yes, you can definitely use this project as a reference to prepare for programming interviews, but I hope that with my writing style and personal touch, I’m able to share with you the same joy and excitement I felt when learning these concepts. I want this to be something you actually enjoy, rather than just a task you slog through to get a job!

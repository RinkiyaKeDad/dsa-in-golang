# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms, as the name suggests, are used to sort an input array in ascending or descending order. These algorithms serve as an excellent starting point if you're just beginning with data structures and algorithms. They not only solidify fundamental programming concepts but also teach you how to think *in terms of code*.

Take your time to thoroughly go through each algorithm, understand the underlying concepts, and analyze the time and space trade-offs for each one.
